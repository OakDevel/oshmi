QUICKSTART:
To quickly run the system after installed, open the OSHMI desktop folder and execute the "HMIShell" program.
Next open the Screen Viewer and the Events Viewer using the HMIShell or the icons on the OSHMI folder.
The system is preconfigured to run a simulation with an example point list and screens.
To simulate a command, click on a breaker and push the "Command" button then choose an action like "open" or "close" and push the action button.
To stop the system click on the "Stop_All" icon on the OSHMI folder.
To edit and create new SVG screens, download and use Inkscape+SAGE, screens are in "c:\oshmi\svg\".
OSHMI configuration files are in "c:\oshmi\conf\".
For more info about configuration please read the OSHMI Configuration Manual.

By default, the system is configured to allow access only by the local machine.
To allow other IP addresses edit the "c:\oshmi\conf\nginx_access_control.conf" file.
